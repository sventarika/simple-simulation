Execute simulation runs defined by [simple-scenario](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/simple-scenario) to efficiently develop scenario-based testing methods (e.g., selecting test scenarios or testing prototype automated driving systems).

# Examples

# Install

To use or develop `simple-simulation`, you must first clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone git@gitlab.ika.rwth-aachen.de:fb-fi/simulation/simple-simulation/simple-simulation.git
$ cd simple-simulation
```

It is recommended to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for package management. If you do not want to use `uv`, please consult the [Without uv](#without-uv) section.

## With uv

Install requirements with

```bash
$ uv sync
```

To run a script, use

```bash
$ uv run /path/to/script.py
```

or directly use the python interpreter from the `.venv` folder in e.g. VSCode.

To run the tests, install the dev requirements with

```bash
$ uv sync --dev
```

and run the tests

```bash
$ uv run pytest
```

## Without uv

Install the project editable

```bash
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

To run the tests, first install pytest

```bash
$ python -m pip install pytest
```

and run

```bash
$ pytest
```
# Use

:bulb: You should first complete the [Installation](#install).

Run some simulations

1. Open the file `test/test_challenger_a.py` and run it by clicking on the run arrow in the top right corner.

2. There should be some videos in the folder `test/test_results/challenger_a/`.

You can watch them directly in VSCode.

# Dev

The `simple_simulation` module consists of the following submodules:

* `simulation_manager/`: Main module handling all other modules to run the main simulation loop.
* `pilots/`: Pilots for the simulation actors. A pilot takes high-level decisions for lateral and longitudinal control for exactly one simulation actor based on the current situation in the simulation. Each pilot must be a subclass of `Pilot` in `pilots/pilot.py`. The logic contained in `highway_pilot.py` is roughly based on that of the [l3pilot-aeb-adf](https://github.com/l3pilot/l3pilot-aeb-adf).
* `simulation_core/`: The lightweight simulation core using [CommonRoad vehicle models](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models).
